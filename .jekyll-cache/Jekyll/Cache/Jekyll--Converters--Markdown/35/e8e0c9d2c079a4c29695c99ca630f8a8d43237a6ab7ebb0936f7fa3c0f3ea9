I"<h1>Quantitative Immunology for Physicist</h1>

<p>The course gives an introduction to modern immunology for physicists, with an emphasis on statistical and evolutionary questions. It is arranged as a weekly discussion group on selected topics in quantitative immunology. For each topic, common reading should first introduce each student to basic concepts. Then, more advanced examples and study cases that are relevant to the topic are provided and discussed. In the discussion session, we will then go together over the central message of the paper(s), possible problems and difficulties, and the relevance for our broader understanding of quantitative immunology. The course is centred around reading and self-study: students are expected to have read the selected paper(s) before each session and to take an active part in the discussion. Moreover, for each week a new chair is assigned to lead the discussion for the topic to be discussed the following week. This includes a short summary of the paper, and possible discussion questions.</p>

      <!--<p>The adaptive immune system is a complex system that protect us from external pathogens and malicious cells of our own body. It relies on the molecular recognition of such threats to trigger a highly complex and coordinated response to erradicate them. It involves the work of several type of cells, among which B and T cells are the most important ones. Immunologist have described successfully many fundamental features of the adaptive immune system that have illuminated us about the great complexity of its components, performance and evolutionary history. However, many open questions remain unsolved, specially from a quantitative point of view. With the seminal work of Alan Perelson in the 70s’, physicist dabbled in the field of immunology and since then have been trying to make quantitative models to breakdown the large complexity of the system.</p>

      <!--<p>The binding of molecules is a ubiquitous process in nature with a great relevance for most (or maybe all) biological processes. In scenarios like the DNA replication, the transcription of genetic material, the synthesis of proteins, the transmission of signals, among many others, molecules need to find their cognate partners and bind to them. A classical and very well studied example is the case of Hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells in charge of transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of our bodies. Understanding their binding properties has triggered a big number of discoveries ranging from the structure of proteins to human physiology. In the case of the immune system, binding events are also a relevant part of the whole complex functioning. One can say, from a perspective of statistical physics, that some part of the great complexity that we observe in how the immune system is organized and how does it work, comes from the collective effect of many rather simple binding interactions between its different participants.</p>
