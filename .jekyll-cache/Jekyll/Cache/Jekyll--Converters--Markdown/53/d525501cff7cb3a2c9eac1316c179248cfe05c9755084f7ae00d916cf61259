I"b<p>The adaptive immune system is a complex system that protect us from external pathogens and malicious cells of our own body. It relies on the molecular recognition of such threats to trigger a highly complex and coordinated response to erradicate them. It involves the work of several type of cells, among which B and T cells are the most important ones. Immunologist have described successfully many fundamental features of the adaptive immune system that have illuminated us about the great complexity of its components, performance and evolutionary history. However, many open questions remain unsolved, specially from a quantitative point of view. With the seminal work of Alan Perelson in the 70sâ€™, physicist dabbled in the field of immunology and since then have been trying to make quantitative models to breakdown the large complexity of the system.</p>
