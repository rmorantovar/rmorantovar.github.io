<h1>Quantitative Immunology for Physicist</h1>

<p>The course gives an introduction to modern immunology for physicists, with an emphasis on statistical and evolutionary questions. It is arranged as a weekly discussion group on selected topics in quantitative immunology. For each topic, common reading should first introduce each student to basic concepts. Then, more advanced examples and study cases that are relevant to the topic are provided and discussed. In the discussion session, we will then go together over the central message of the paper(s), possible problems and difficulties, and the relevance for our broader understanding of quantitative immunology. The course is centred around reading and self-study: students are expected to have read the selected paper(s) before each session and to take an active part in the discussion. Moreover, for each week a new chair is assigned to lead the discussion for the topic to be discussed the following week. This includes a short summary of the paper, and possible discussion questions.</p>

      <!--<p>The adaptive immune system is a complex system that protect us from external pathogens and malicious cells of our own body. It relies on the molecular recognition of such threats to trigger a highly complex and coordinated response to erradicate them. It involves the work of several type of cells, among which B and T cells are the most important ones. Immunologist have described successfully many fundamental features of the adaptive immune system that have illuminated us about the great complexity of its components, performance and evolutionary history. However, many open questions remain unsolved, specially from a quantitative point of view. With the seminal work of Alan Perelson in the 70sâ€™, physicist dabbled in the field of immunology and since then have been trying to make quantitative models to breakdown the large complexity of the system.</p>
