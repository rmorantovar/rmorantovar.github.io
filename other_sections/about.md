<center > <h1> About me </h1>  </center> {:class="title"}


I am from Bogotá, Colombia, where I studied Physics and Biology (minor). I am a PhD student at M. Lässig group at the Institute for Biological Physics at the University of Cologne. I am interested in the application of methods from Statistical Physics in Evolution. More specifically, my current research is centered in understanding the coevolution of viruses and the adaptive immune sistem of vertebrates.
