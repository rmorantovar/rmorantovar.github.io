  <h1>The immune system</h1>

 <p><b>Abstract:</b> The immune response to an acute primary infection is a coupled process of antigen proliferation, molecular recognition by naive B-cells, and their subsequent proliferation and antibody shedding. Here we show B-cells can efficiently recognise new antigens by a tuned kinetic proofreading mechanism, where the number of proofreading steps and the characteristic rate of each step are set by the complexity of the immune repertoire. This process produces potent, specific and fast recognition of antigens, maintaining a spectrum of genetically distinct B-cell lineages as input for affinity maturation. We show that the proliferation-recognition dynamics of a primary infection can me mapped onto a generalised Luria-Delbr√ºck process, akin to the dynamics of the classic fluctuation experiment. We derive the resulting statistics of the activated immune repertoire: antigen binding affinity, expected size, and frequency of active B-cell clones are related by power laws. Their exponents depend on the antigen and B-cell proliferation rate, the number of proofreading steps, and the lineage density of the naive repertoire. Empirical data of mouse immune repertoires are found to be consistent with activation involving at least three proofreading steps. Our model predicts key clinical characteristics of acute infections. The primary immune response to a given antigen is strongly heterogeneous across individuals; few elite responders are distinguished by early activation of high-affinity clones. Conversely, ageing of the immune system, by reducing the density of naive clones, degrades potency and speed of pathogen recognition. </p>

 <p><b>Abstract:</b> Global strategies to contain a pandemic, such as social distancing and protective measures, are designed to reduce the overall transmission rate between individuals. Despite such measures, essential institutions, including hospitals, schools, and food producing plants, remain focal points of local outbreaks. Here we develop a model for the stochastic outbreak dynamics in such local communities. We derive analytical expressions for the probability of containment of the outbreak, which is complementary to the probability of seeding a deterministically growing epidemic. This probability depends on the statistics of the intra-community contact network and the initial conditions, in particular, on the contact degree of patient zero. Based on this model, we suggest surveillance protocols by which individuals are tested proportionally to their degree in the contact network. We characterize the efficacy of contact-based protocols as a function of the epidemiological and the contact network parameters, and show numerically that such protocols outperform random testing. </p>
