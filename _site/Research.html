 <p><b>Abstract:</b> Global strategies to contain a pandemic, such as social distancing and protective measures, are designed to reduce the overall transmission rate between individuals. Despite such measures, essential institutions, including hospitals, schools, and food producing plants, remain focal points of local outbreaks. Here we develop a model for the stochastic outbreak dynamics in such local communities. We derive analytical expressions for the probability of containment of the outbreak, which is complementary to the probability of seeding a deterministically growing epidemic. This probability depends on the statistics of the intra-community contact network and the initial conditions, in particular, on the contact degree of patient zero. Based on this model, we suggest surveillance protocols by which individuals are tested proportionally to their degree in the contact network. We characterize the efficacy of contact-based protocols as a function of the epidemiological and the contact network parameters, and show numerically that such protocols outperform random testing. </p>
